IE Bootstrap Carousel
=====================

IE Bootstrap Carousel is a fork of Twitter's Bootstrap Carousel, which can be found here: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel.  It is intended to bring support for Twitter's Carousel to Internet Explorer 8 and 9.  It does so by adding jQuery animations for browsers that do not support CSS3 Transitions.

How do I use it?
----------
1. Include either the development or the minified version of ie-bootstrap-carousel.js in your project. 
2. If, for some reason, you have another version of the bootstrap carousel on your page you should remove it.  Or, at the very least, make sure this one is declared last so that it can overwrite the other one.
3. Use the bootstrap carousel the way that you normally would.

Notes
-----
The default Bootstrap Carousel is meant only to show sliding animations.  There [are](https://coderwall.com/p/w4k7sw) [ways](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10335181/twitter-bootstraps-carousel-fade-transition) to make it use a fade animation instead.  An attempt has been made to make this fallback work for fades as well.  The implementation tested with is a slight variation of [this one](https://coderwall.com/p/w4k7sw).
